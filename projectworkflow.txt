---------------------- setting up project structure ------------

1. create a virtual environment named 'atlas' : conda create -n atlas python=3.10
2. Activate the atlas env : conda activate atlas
3. pip install cookiecutter : to build project structure, the have multiple templetes on github i guess
   so it just create files and build project struture.
4. "cookiecutter -c v1 https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science" : to copy the templete (skip aws things we will setup this manually)
5. cut all files from newly created and past on root folder
6. rename src.models to src.model becasue we already have model in root so its like just to make the mind clear.
7. git push origin main
